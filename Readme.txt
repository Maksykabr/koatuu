In this project I have create a program which take all data from koatuu.json parse parse it to Java Script objects and
then it sorts them to different level. After work with objects program iterate all objects and create new array inside an old one 
and it adds there all objects which belong to this objects. After all operation the program convert js objects to json format
and write all data to new file.
